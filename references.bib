	abstract = {This thesis depicts approaches toward real-time depth sensing. While humans are very good at estimating distances and hence are able to smoothly control vehicles and their own movements, machines often lack the ability to sense their environment in a manner comparable to humans. This discrepancy prevents the automation of certain job steps. We assume that further enhancement of depth sensing technologies might change this fact. We examine to what extend time-of-flight ({ToF}) cameras are able to provide reliable depth images in real-time. We discuss current issues with existing real-time imaging methods and technologies in detail and present several approaches to enhance real-time depth imaging. We focus on {ToF} imaging and the utilization of {ToF} cameras based on the photonic mixer device ({PMD}) principle. These cameras provide per pixel distance information in real-time. However, the measurement contains several error sources. We present approaches to indicate measurement errors and to determine the reliability of the data from these sensors. If the reliability is known, combining the data with other sensors will become possible. We describe such a combination of {ToF} and stereo cameras that enables new interactive applications in the field of computer graphics. In addition, we show how the fusion of multiple exposures entails improved measurements and extended applications.},
